## :collision: Dont's and Show stoppers

From my own experience I know it is hard to organise events, and have every think planned and
in mind. In general I try to get my own experience and opinion about ppl and events.
Here is a general list of things that I see as minimum for events:

* :x: I expect the conference to have an enforced code of conduct
* :x: I don't speak on events that are known for treating the community, speakers as well as attendees disrespectfully.
* :x: I don't "pay to play". As a presenter, the minimum I expect is travel expanse and hotel as well as full access to the event.
* :x: The event should have at least minimal support for the community.
      As community enthusiast  and active contributor I welcome support of the community and will actively share the event wherever I'm active.

## :dancer: My deliveries at your event

Here's what I will do when invited as a presenter at your event.

- [x] **Deliver a fitting talk/workshop for the intended audience.** I tend to deliver a unique talk every time I can and it will be an up-to-date talk.
- [x] **Deliver the talk/workshop on time and sticking to the defined format and duration.** I need to know what time frame you expect and what format you want it to be in. I will show up at the times you need me to be there and set up on stage with enough time for AV people to wire up microphones and other equipment.
- [x] **Be available for conference attendees.** Conferences to me are more about the people than about the content. Therefore I will try to be there for questions and feedback.
- [x] **Be available for other promotional parts of the event.** I am happy to do interviews or give you feedback to use in conference wrap-ups
- [x] **Promote my presence at your event.** I will tweet before, during and after the event about what I will do at your event and interesting things I encounter.
- [x] **Publish my slides after my talk.**  After the conference I will share the slides over a public lik. All the slides will have the conferences logo/brand included.

## :computer: My setup

I am pretty open to different ways of presenting, but here is my perfect setup

- [x] I like to use my own computer as I have them set up the way I need and there may be coding examples.
- [x] I either use a Windows Laptop. Mini Display Ports, HDMI, NO LAN Wifi only. I also carry several dongles to connect from VGA to HDMI or Lan to USB.
- [x] I need almost every time a connection to the internet.

If I need to use a central computer instead of mine, please consider the following:

- [x] My slides are on Google Slides and 16:9 format. I will send them 1 to 2 days before the conference and also have them on a memory stick.
- [x] I general a rarly use videos or audios in my slides but some GIF animations. If this is the case i will send this files also front off for a teat.
- [x] I don't need notes, but I want to have a remote clicker and a "nanny screen" where I can see my slides instead of having to refer to the screen behind me.

## :pray: My expectations

I am a professional presenter, and will do a lot to ensure that the event will be a success.
As such, I have a few expectations I want met:

- [ ] **A time slot before lunch** I mostly do very techie topics. If so it's proofed that the audience has the best takeaway be before lunch.
- [ ] **Deliver a professional stage setup.** I bring my own laptop and connectors, but I expect at least a power plug and a microphone and a "nanny screen".
- [ ] **Record and publish my talk.** Recordings are a great advertisement for your conference I welcome recordings and will also share them on social media.

## :money_with_wings: Cost and payments/expenses

- [ ] **If possible, I'd like you to cover my travel and hotel.** I don't expect first class or business class flights, but I do expect to arrive a day before the event and leave the day after with lodging organised in between.
I would like you to take care of bookings but I can also book and pay myself and get reimbursed.
- [ ] **I don't expect to be paid for my presentations if your conference helps me in my work.**
However, if you pay others I expect the same. I want to get treaten with the same respect as the rest of the conference.
- [ ] **I do expect to be paid for my workshops and trainings. This is what i make my living of.**
If you book me for a workshop and we did not agree on something else I expect to be payed for my workshop.

There are always options to haggle about these things. I'm a reasonable person and if you spend your time creating a great event where money isn't your main goal, we'll find a way.

## :boom: Things can go wrong...

Even with the best intentions, there may be trouble and I might not be available for your event.
You may also change your mind. If that happens, here's what I want to happen.

- [x] When I can not attend for some reason or another, I will make very much sure to find a replacement presenter to fill in for me. I have a vast network of speaker, trainer and teacher who can help out.
- [x] When for some reason you decide to slash my speaking slot,
I expect you to cover the cost involved for me.
Often I can book my own flights as I book other appointments around events.
Many of them aren't refundable.
